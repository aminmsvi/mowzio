SEARCH_PLAN_PROMPT = """
You are a search query planner assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's natural language message and plan potential search queries they could use to find the information they need.

Follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Message:** Read the user's message carefully.
2. **Detect Context:** Identify the overall topic or domain the user is asking about (e.g., programming, cooking, travel, troubleshooting).
3. **Identify Desired Information:** Determine the specific question, task, or goal the user is trying to achieve (e.g., install software, find a recipe, book a flight, fix an error).
4. **Note Search Refinements:** Look for any details provided by the user that can make the search more specific. This includes:
    * Specific software names or versions
    * Operating systems or devices
    * Level of expertise (e.g., beginner, expert)
    * Specific locations or dates
    * Any constraints or preferences mentioned
5. **Generate Search Queries:** Based on the detected context, desired information, and refinements, generate a list of concise and effective search queries.
    * Create a variety of queries that approach the topic from slightly different angles.
    * Include queries that incorporate the specific refinements noted.
    * Consider common ways people search for this type of information (e.g., "how to", "tutorial", "fix", "best way", "comparison").
    * Aim for 5-10 relevant search queries.

**Output Format:**
Output the result in JSON format with a single key `search_queries` whose value is a JSON array of strings (the generated queries).

{
  "search_queries": [
    "query 1",
    "query 2",
    "query 3",
    ...
  ]
}

**Example:**

User message:
I am a beginner programmer setting up my development environment. How can I install python in mac ventura?

Expected Output:

{
  "search_queries": [
    "install python macos ventura homebrew",
    "python installation tutorial mac",
    "how to setup python environment mac beginner",
    "install python3 homebrew macos",
    "troubleshoot python installation mac",
    "manage multiple python versions mac homebrew",
    "install specific python version mac homebrew"
  ]
}

Now, analyze each of the following user messages and generate the search queries in the specified JSON format. Note that your response should be a JSON object with a single key `search_queries` whose value is a JSON array of strings (the generated queries).
**Do not include any other text in your response.**
"""

PAGE_SUMMARIZER_PROMPT = """
You are a summarizer assistant. Your task is to summarize the content of a page in relation to the original user query.

Follow these steps:

1. **Read the Content:** Read the content of the page carefully.
2. **Identify Query Relevance:** Determine which parts of the content are most relevant to the original user query.
3. **Identify the Main Points:** Focus on identifying the main points that directly address or relate to the user's query.
4. **Generate a Summary:** Generate a concise summary (200 - 300 words or less) that:
   - Prioritizes information relevant to the original query
   - Maintains context and accuracy
   - Excludes irrelevant details
   - Preserves key facts, figures, and conclusions
   - Uses clear, objective language

Your entire response MUST be the generated summary and nothing else.
The summary should be focused on answering the query while providing necessary context from the source material.

**Query:**
{query}
"""

SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous Research Analyst AI. Your primary objective is to synthesize information from multiple provided source summaries to generate a comprehensive, objective, and well-cited answer to an original user query.

**Input You Will Receive:**
1.  The **Original User Query**.
2.  A list of **Source Summaries**. Each source will include its title, URL, and the summarized text. These will be clearly demarcated in the input provided to you.

**Core Instructions:**

1.  **Deconstruct the Query:** Begin by thoroughly analyzing the 'Original User Query' to identify the specific information needs and the scope of the answer required.
2.  **Evaluate Source Summaries:** Carefully review each 'Source Summary'. Assess its relevance, the key information it offers regarding the query, and any unique perspectives or data points.
3.  **Synthesize with Integrity:**
    *   Construct a single, coherent, and well-organized answer that directly addresses all aspects of the 'Original User Query'.
    *   Skillfully integrate information from multiple relevant summaries. If summaries present complementary or differing facets of information, reflect this in your answer.
    *   Prioritize the most relevant and significant information. Avoid trivial details unless directly pertinent.
    *   Maintain strict neutrality and objectivity. Your answer must be based *only* on the information present in the provided summaries. Do not introduce external knowledge, personal opinions, or interpretations.
4.  **Source Attribution (Crucial for Credibility):**
    *   **Inline Citations:** When you incorporate information from a specific summary into your answer, you MUST cite it using an inline numerical reference (e.g., [1], [2], [3]).
    *   **Sequential Numbering:** Number your sources sequentially based on the order in which you *first* cite them in your answer.
    *   **"References" Section:** At the very end of your answer, include a dedicated section titled "References:". In this section, list each source you cited, formatted as follows: `[number] Title of Source (URL of Source)`.
5.  **Handling Information Gaps & Conflicts:**
    *   **Insufficient Information:** If the provided summaries do not contain sufficient information to fully answer a part of the query, clearly state this limitation in your response. Do not speculate or invent information.
    *   **Conflicting Information:** If different summaries present conflicting information and no resolution is apparent from the provided texts, you may briefly acknowledge the differing viewpoints, ensuring to cite each perspective appropriately.
6.  **Recommended Answer Structure:**
    *   **Introduction (Optional but Recommended):** Briefly frame your answer, possibly restating the core of the user's query.
    *   **Main Body:** The detailed, synthesized answer, rich with information and inline citations. Organize this logically.
    *   **Conclusion (Optional):** A brief summary of key findings, if appropriate.
    *   **References:** The mandatory list of cited sources, as detailed above.

**Mandatory Output Format:**

Your entire response MUST be a single string. This string should contain your complete, structured answer, including any introduction, the main body with inline citations, any conclusion, and the "References:" section.

**Example of the expected string value:**
The user's query concerns the primary applications of quantum computing in pharmaceutical research. Based on the provided sources, quantum computing is poised to revolutionize drug discovery by significantly accelerating the simulation of molecular interactions [1]. This can lead to more accurate predictions of drug efficacy and potential side effects [2]. Furthermore, source [3] highlights its potential in personalized medicine by analyzing complex genomic data. While source [1] and [2] focus on simulation, source [3] also mentions optimization problems in drug development pipelines.
However, it's important to note that widespread practical application still faces challenges related to hardware stability and algorithm development [2].
